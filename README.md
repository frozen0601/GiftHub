## Inspiration
Students who graduated long ago and whom we've nearly forgotten sometimes come back to my parents with greetings, caring messages, and gifts. This thoughtful gesture of maintaining relationships, even after we've gone our separate ways, has shown me the importance of networking and how meaningful it can be to the receiver. Realizing that I'm not great at managing my network, I was inspired to create HeartBranch. Designed to help you keep the spark alive in your connections, whether through sending a caring message, small tokens of appreciation, or grand gestures of love, our platform ensures you always remain unforgettable to those who matter most.

## Features
HeartBranch combines the functionality of a contacts notebook with the social connectivity of a gifting platform:

1. **Priority Contacts**:
   - Set priority and importance levels for your contacts.
   - Reminders to send gifts or messages every six months or annually.

2. **Data Integration**:
   - Analyze potential and scores.
   - Integrate with social platforms, whether it's your Facebook or Instagram account for your personal network, or LinkedIn to maintain professional connections.

3. **Social Features**:
   - Users can choose to make their gifting records public or private.
   - Access to a customizable dashboard and detailed statistics.
    
4. **Penny Gifting**:
   - Small amounts (1, 5, 10 units of currency).
   - The receiver gets a notification: "XXX has sent you a token of appreciation."
   - High frequency and fast circulation.

5. **Traditional Gifting**:
   - Larger amounts.
   - Lower frequency, more significant gestures.

6. **Additional Motivations**:
   - Earn badges and appear on leaderboards.

## Development Roadmap
1. **Initial Phase**:
   - Focus on social reminders and organizing contacts (offline, functional features).
2. **Phase 2**:
   - Introduce the Penny feature (online community, generating cash flow).
3. **Phase 3**:
   - Add a marketplace, transfer and payment features, and establish a digital currency.

## Monetization
1. **Penny Gifts**:
   - Generate substantial cash flow through frequent, small transactions.
2. **Gift Sharing & Social Influence**:
   - Reduced price sensitivity due to the social nature of gifting, making marketplace sales easier.

HeartBranch aims to transform the way you nurture your relationships, making it easy and rewarding to show you care.
